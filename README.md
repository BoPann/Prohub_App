# Prohub_App
## A prototype of course management system that support online learning and progress tracking
## Java, Gradle, SQL, mySQL Workbench
### Canvas, a well-known learning management system, is seen as having room for improvement by incorporating additional interactive elements. That's why we developed the Prohub application, which includes interactive content like quizzes and feedback tools, as well as a collaboration feature called the "promate system" to facilitate student teamwork.
### Developing this application provides me with valuable insights into the software engineering profession. Throughout the semester, my peers and I engage in extensive online meetings, discussions, and collaborative efforts to achieve our goals. Furthermore, this experience affords us the opportunity to engage in the complete software development lifecycle, including planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and integration phases.
